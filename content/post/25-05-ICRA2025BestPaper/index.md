Terrestrial and aerial bimodal vehicles have
gained significant interest due to their energy efficiency and
versatile maneuverability across different domains. However,
most existing passive-wheeled bimodal vehicles rely on attitude
regulation to generate forward thrust, which inevitably results
in energy waste on producing lifting force. In this work,
we propose a novel passive-wheeled bimodal vehicle called
TrofyBot that can rapidly change the thrust direction with a
single servo motor and a transformable parallelogram linkage
mechanism (TPLM). Cooperating with a bidirectional force
generation module (BFGM) for motors to produce bidirectional
thrust, the robot achieves flexible mobility as a differential
driven rover on the ground. This design achieves 95.37%
energy saving efficiency in terrestrial locomotion, allowing the
robot continuously move on the ground for more than two
hours in current setup. Furthermore, the design obviates the
need for attitude regulation and therefore provides a stable
sensor field of view (FoV). We model the bimodal dynamics
for the system, analyze its differential flatness property, and
design a controller based on hybrid model predictive control
for trajectory tracking. A prototype is built and extensive
experiments are conducted to verify the design and the proposed
controller, which achieves high energy efficiency and seamless
transition between modes.

As the world’s top robotics conference, ICRA 2025 (hosted by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society) drew thousands of global experts, focusing on AI-driven robotics, human-robot interaction, and sustainable automation. Lai’s paper stood out among hundreds of submissions, selected via rigorous peer review for technical excellence, originality, and impact on robotics advancement.​
