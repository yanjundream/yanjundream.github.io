Chao Xu, Expert in the JW Technology Committee, Member of the Expert Group for a National Major Scientific and Technological Project, and Selected as a Leading Talent under Zhejiang Province's "Ten Thousand Talents Program," was honored with the 2024 Frontier Science Award in the category of Theoretical Computer Science and Information Science at the International Conference on Basic Sciences (ICBS). The ICBS, initiated by Professor Shing-Tung Yau, has previously recognized Nobel Prize in Physics laureates and Turing Award winners, including Geoffrey Hinton.Chao Xu is engaged in interdisciplinary research on "Cybernetics and Robotic Learning Systems," focusing on addressing national strategic needs and overcoming core technologies in intelligent control for unmanned system swarms. He has published groundbreaking results in top journals such as Science Robotics, Nature Machine Intelligence, Nature Communications, and Nature Biomedical Engineering, and was recognized in the Elsevier Global Top 2% Scientists List. He led the formulation of IEEE international standards for intelligent drones, which were adopted by the American National Standards Institute. Chao Xu founded the international journal IET Cyber-Systems & Robotics (ESCI indexed) and serves as Executive Editor-in-Chief. The swarm robotics developed under his leadership was featured in the "Striving for a New Era" National Achievements Exhibition and is permanently collected by the National Museum. Several of his research achievements have been prominently reported by national media, including CCTV's Into Key Labs, as well as Science and Technology Daily, Guangming Daily, CCTV Channel 2, Zhejiang Provincial News, and The Times.
