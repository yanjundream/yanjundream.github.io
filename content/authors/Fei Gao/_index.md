Fei Gao is a Tenured Associate Professor, Researcher, and Doctoral Supervisor at the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University. He is also the Founder and CEO of Differential Robotics, and a recipient of the Excellent Young Scientists Fund from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (2024–2026). He earned his bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University and his Ph.D. from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. His primary research interests include aerial robotics, autonomous navigation, swarm cooperation, and embodied intelligence. As the first or corresponding author, he has published over 100 papers in internationally renowned robotics journals and conferences in recent years, including 4 in Science Robotics, 7 in IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO), and numerous in RSS, ICRA, and IROS. He proposed the world’s first autonomous aerial swarm system for unstructured environments, published as a cover paper in the prestigious journal Science Robotics. This milestone was highlighted in an NSFC special report and received extensive global media coverage. As principal investigator, he has led several key national research projects, including the NSFC Excellent Young Scientists Fund and the National Key R&D Program Young Scientists Project. He has received numerous awards, such as the IEEE TRO 2020 Best Paper Honorable Mention, the IEEE/RSJ IROS 2021 Best Application Paper Award Finalist, Zhejiang University’s Top 10 Academic Achievements of 2022, two IEEE ICRA Best Paper Award Finalists (2024 and 2025), the Alibaba DAMO Academy Young Fellow Award (Most Promising Potential, 2022 and 2024), and the International Congress of Basic Science (ICBS) 2024 Frontier Science Award. He has also been recognized as a Top 2% Most-Cited Scientist in the Elsevier Global Scientist Rankings (2023 and 2024) and listed among China’s Highly Cited Scholars.
