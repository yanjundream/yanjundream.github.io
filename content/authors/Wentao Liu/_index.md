I am a Ph.D. student in Control Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University. My research focuses on learning-based control and motion planning for aerial robots, aiming to enable autonomous, safe, and efficient flight in complex environments.

Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of robotics, control theory, and artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on integrating machine learning and optimal control to enhance autonomy and adaptability in aerial systems.
